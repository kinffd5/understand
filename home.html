<p> &phmmat;Small business thrives in a small town in America, they were
    banking, finance, production, capacity, energy, sources, and 
    transportation they have been supportive by the
    people. 
<a href="vc.jpg">THe unknown</a>
those past entrepreneurs are those whom we should be emulating today, so we can
use them for example as a stepping-stone, for a prosperous and productive
America. they are people that invented things, we use daily and take
for granted:

<p>Sam Walton set the stage for walmart,
    Albert Spalding, became a big supplyer for stors
    Orville and Wilbur, built and design aircraft, which we use and take from granted, the airplane.
    Nolan Bushel created the first video game, 
    Walt Disney and other peple created cartoon animation, which is enjoy all around the world, and etc..</p>

<h2>  What do we do???</h2>
<hr> 
<br>

<p> I watch the news, and the earth is getting polluted by gas, toxic, and
    other dangerous substances that are not good, for the environment.
    We should protect the environment, and do good kinds of stuff that benefit, everyone. 
    we should do what we can every day to support our government, people, and the country.

<p> U.S company were getting worried, that manufacturing company were
    moving to china, and providing technology for this country, and the Chinese government were watching, and china stole important information from 103 countries,
    and it is putting policy to increase its's country economic growth and Military.
    China has successfully extracted western technology. we consumed product made in china, but the
    things that worry the government in China and what will happen when 
    they are not the number one country, with the highest GDP.
</p>

<p> They say china does not obey the human right and most of the product
    we use are produced by people, who are underpaid, safety and health are a major risk factor, 
    excessive hours, violation of child labor law, and etc...
</p>



<h2>Politics, politics, and politics??? </h2>
<hr> 
<br>

<p> Why do government agrees to and disagrees to do something, 
    maybe that's the way politics is, but the country is not perfect, and we should help those countries in need, and at least provided certain help that will benefit the government and it's people.
</p>

<p> I read that the name of the book, Polaris effect is from the northern star, the reason the author gave it the name,
    is because it was widely used by ancient and mordern civilizations. the northern star is known as the "Most important star in
    heaven". he said that America now more than ever, needs a north star, a Polaris to help them navigate their way back to economic
    prosperity. In the end, he said, we need to work together, united as one to support, our country and the economy. 
</p>

<p> Roedel said we must remain united in continuing what of the founder of this country began,
"One nation, undergod, indivisible with liberty and justice for all".
We need to Re-industrialize our country, that's what we need.
